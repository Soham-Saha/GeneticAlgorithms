Just checking if I can build an GA implementation from the scratch.

Java project to evolve a rudimentary impression of "Monalisa" with respect to the given target. 500 translucent rectangles are used with a pseudo Genetic Algorithm (only mutation). Hyperparameters are initially set and adapted manually to the image fitness score. Manhattan distance measure between the pixel colors is used for calculating the fitness score.

The file named Monalisa.java is the main output of this project.
